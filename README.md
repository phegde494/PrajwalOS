A simple operating system built from scratch using bare-metal programming in x86 assembly and C. This OS runs on x86 architecture.

Use the `make run` command to launch the OS. A bootloader will jump to the kernel, which will create a simple shell using qemu.

The functionality includes a terminal-style shell, along with support for keyboard and screen.

Work currently in progress.
