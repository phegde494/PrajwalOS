# PrajwalOS
A simple operating system that can run on any machine with x86 architecture.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Built from scratch using bare-metal programming in x86 assembly and C.

Use the `make run` command to launch the OS. A bootloader will jump to the kernel, which will create a simple shell using qemu.

### Functionality: 
Terminal-style shell, device drivers for keyboard and screen to power IO operations, and support for a few Unix commands.
